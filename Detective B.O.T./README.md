1.	Navigate to Detective B.O.T. at [aka.ms/detectivebot](https://aka.ms/detectivebot)

4.	Look at the Crime Scene Images you used to test your Custom Vision model - which rooms were identified as having what murder weapon? Look at the list of potential guesses below - are you able to narrow down the guesses?
5.	Now review the statements you analysed in your logic app - Who had the most negative sentiment score 
6.	How many tries does it take you to guess correctly?

**Here is a reminder of your potential guesses**

Mrs. White | Candlestick | Kitchen
Mr. Green | Wrench | Conservatory
Mrs. Peacock | Rope | Dining Room
Professor Plum  | | Cellar
